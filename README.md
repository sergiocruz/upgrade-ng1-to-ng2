## Steps to Upgrade

Maybe you've heard that it is possible to slowly upgrade an AngularJS (1.x) application into Angular (2+), but have tried to do so and there were too many steps. Maybe you've tried following [this guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html) but they were either too long or didn't make much sense.

My goal for this repository is to give you a fully functioning Angular 1.x app that uses ES2015+ and is packagked with `gulp`, `babel` and `browserify`. Then we will go through the steps to upgrade this app piece-by-piece to Angular 2 (with TypeScript).

## Running the app

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

1. `git clone <repo url>` and `cd` into the repo directory
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

Running `npm start` should get the app running in a local webserver.

## Navigating through the branches

This project has different branches with the different upgrade steps. Be sure to run `npm install` every time you change branches as we may have brought in different dependencies depending on which step we're on.

I hope this is useful, and you all enjoy it :)

## Upgrade steps

### 1 - Start here _([see branch](https://github.com/sergiocruz/upgrade-ng1-to-ng2/tree/1-start-here))_

Go here to see the initial app working before the upgrade. These were the tools used to build this app:

- [Angular 1.5](https://angularjs.org/)
- [UI-Router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

### 2 - TypeScript _([see branch](https://github.com/sergiocruz/upgrade-ng1-to-ng2/tree/2-typescript))_

1. TypeScript
  1. installed `typescript` and created `tsconfig.json`
  1. renamed `app/app.js` to `app/app.ts`
1. Typings
  1. installed `typings` and added needed dependencies for this project
  1. ie. `typings install dt~angular --save --global`, etc (see `typings.json`)
  1. added npm `postinstall` script to install typings every time
1. Gulp
  1. installed `tsify`
  1. replaced `bundler.transform(babelify)` with `bundler.plugin(tsify)`
  1. set entry file as `app/app.ts`
1. Code
  1. Using `require('angular')` because of global dependencies _(tricking the compiler)_
  1. Changed default imports to `* as x` syntax
    1. went from `import uiRouter from 'angular-ui-router'`
    1. to `import * as uiRouter from 'angular-ui-router'`

### 3 - Bootstrap with Angular 2 _([see branch](https://github.com/sergiocruz/upgrade-ng1-to-ng2/tree/3-angular2))_

1. Manual bootstrapping with Angular 1.x
  1. remove `ng-app` from `index.html`
  1. add manual bootstrap code
1. Install Angular 2 dependencies
  1. ng2 upgrade libraries (RC5)
  1. auxiliary libs: `reflect-metadata`, `rxjs`, `zone.js`
  1. create new `ng-upgrade.ts` file, export an instance of `new UpgradeAdapter()`
1. Bootstrap with ng2 instead of ng1
  1. in `app.ts`, swap `angular.bootstrap()` with `upgradeAdapter.bootstrap()`

### 4 - Convert Directive to Component _([see branch](https://github.com/sergiocruz/upgrade-ng1-to-ng2/tree/4-first-component))_

This is where we start applying Angular 2 principles to our application. For this exercise we will upgrade the `<weather-preview>` directive to an Angular 2 component.

1. In `weather-preview.js` declare the component's structure
  1. comment out the current directive declaration
  1. import `Component` from `@angular/core`
  1. declare `WeatherPreview` class and use the `@Component()`
  1. declare the `selector` and a temporary hello world `template`
1. In `weather/index.js`, downgrade the component to a directive
  1. import `{WeatherPreview}` class
  1. update `directive` by keeping same selector but replace declaration with `upgradeAdapter.downgradeNg2Component(WeatherPreview)`
  1. go to view and "hello world" text should be on screen
1. Finish migrating directive
  1. copy old commented out template to new component template
  1. Inject `Weather` service into component class
    1. in `weather/index.js`, call `upgradeAdapter.upgradeNg1Provider('Weather')`
    1. in the component declaration, add a `constructor(@Inject('Weather') private Weather){}`
  1. set `@Input() weather` and change template to use `[weather]` instead in `main.html`
  1. update component template syntax
    1. replace `ng-if` with `*ngIf`
    1. replace `class` with `[ngClass]='wi ' + getIcon()`
    1. replace `{{ weather.main.temp | number:0 }}` with `getTemperature()`
      1. so formatting can happen at class level
      1. there is no `number` built-in pipe at the moment
      1. if done too often, it is worth writing one
    1. replace `ui-sref=""` with simple `href`
